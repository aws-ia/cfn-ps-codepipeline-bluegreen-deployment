## Blue-Green Deployment on the AWS Cloud

This Quick Start automatically builds an architecture for blue-green deployment to an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Beanstalk environment using AWS CodePipeline. The Quick Start creates a continuous integration/continuous delivery pipeline for a cost-effective, fault-tolerant architecture. The deployment is automated by an AWS CloudFormation template and takes about 15 minutes.

You can deploy with or without Git to Amazon S3 integration.

This Quick Start also provides a sample Elastic Beanstalk environment for illustration and demonstration purposes only.
